-   [ruff] for code formatting and linting
-   [mypy] for type checking
-   [hatch-pip-compile] for dependency management + lockfiles
-   [pre-commit] for managing git hooks
-   [GitHub Actions] for CI/CD
-   [MkDocs] and [mkdocs-material] for documentation
-   [GitHub Pages] for hosting documentation
-   [semantic-release] and [gitmoji] for automated releases
-   Publishes to [PyPI] and [Docker Hub]

## Quickstart Guide

### Requirements

Install [cookiecutter]:

```shell
pipx install cookiecutter
```

[pipx] is preferred, but you can also install with `pip install --user`.

### Creating a project

#### Cookiecutter

Generate a Python project:

```shell
cookiecutter gh:juftin/cookiecutter-python
```

#### Git Init

Change to the root directory of your new project, create a Git
repository, and install [pre-commit]

```shell
git init
pre-commit install
git add .
pre-commit run --all-files
git add .
git commit
```

Also, make sure to commit your lockfiles, they're created at `requirements.txt`
and in the `requirements` directory. They will be created automatically
when you run a `hatch` command in the respective environment for the first time.

```shell
hatch run cov
hatch run lint:all
hatch run docs:serve
git add requirements.txt requirements/
git commit -m "üîê add lockfiles"
```

#### Secrets Init

This project uses GitHub Actions to deploy releases, documentation, and
to publish artifacts to PyPI / Docker Hub. You will need to create
secrets in your GitHub repository to enable these features.

-   `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`: A GitHub Personal Access Token with `repo` permissions
-   `PYPI_TOKEN`: Your PyPI token (optional)
-   `DOCKER_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username (optional)
-   `DOCKER_TOKEN`: Your Docker Hub token (optional)

A `.env` file is provided in the project root for local development, to
sync your secrets to GitHub, run the following command with the [GitHub CLI]:

```shell
gh secret set --env-file .env
```

#### cruft

[cruft] is a tool for updating cookiecutter templates after they've been
generated. To use cruft, install it with `pipx`:

```shell
pipx install cruft
```

Then, use `cruft` instead of `cookiecutter` to generate your project:

```shell
cruft create https://github.com/juftin/cookiecutter-python
```

Later, if you want to update your project with the latest changes from
the template:

```shell
cruft update
```

#### Developing

This project generates its own documentation for how to use the
project's tools. To view the documentation locally, run:

```shell
hatch run docs:serve
```

Once the server is running, you can view the documentation at
[localhost:8080/contributing] or see a preview at [juftin.com/cookiecutter-python/contributing].
